## About Me
My name is Amani. I was born in Sweden but grew up in Central Florida. Growing up, I used to play soccer, golf, and even dabbled in some pole vaulting. My husband and I had our wedding this past Saturday. I am still buzzing from the incredible night and unforgettable weekend.
I am excited to dive deeper into the world of web design.   
## Past Coding Experience
I took programming 1 and 2 almost 10 years ago at UF but I haven't had much opportunity to practice or apply it much since. 
## Career Goals
1. Expand my role and expertise within the marketing department at my current job. 
2. Familiarize myself and gain proficiency in web design.
3. Advance my coding skills.
